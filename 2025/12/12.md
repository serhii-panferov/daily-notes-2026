### ⭐ What I learned
-  Refining the middleware flow to keep the logic clean and predictable, while reducing coupling and improving maintainability.
Example:
Auth => ValidateInput => CheckPermissions => HandleRequest

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Added a centralized method to extract and validate public ID/UUID from request parameters or session in the workflow
- Reworked the workflow to use a centralized method for extracting public ID/UUIDs.

### 🔍 Notes / Discoveries
- Incorrect microservices architecture can cause GitHub workflow to stall for weeks.

### 🎯 Next small step
- Learning Go and strengthening my understanding of its syntax.
