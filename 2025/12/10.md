### ⭐ What I learned
- Looked into PHP performance tricks (array operations, string ops).

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Create a common laravel-sail-boilerplate
- Wrote a micro-benchmark comparing array_map and foreach.
- Migrated from PHP 8.0 to 8.4 on Mac OS with brew:
  ```
  1. brew update
  2. brew upgrade
  3. brew unlink php@8.0
  4. brew install php@8.4
  5. brew link --overwrite --force php@8.4
  6. Comment # export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.0/bin:$PATH" in ~/.bash_profile
  7. Add in ~/.bash_profile
      export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
      export PATH="/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH"
  8. Restrt shell:  source ~/.bash_profile
  9. brew services restart php@8.4
  ```

### 🔍 Notes / Discoveries
- Foreach is still extremely efficient.
- Packages from PHP 8.0 works with PHP 8.4

### 🎯 Next small step
- Try a small optimization exercise.
