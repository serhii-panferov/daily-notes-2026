### ⭐ What I learned
- Google Reservations Business Link integration

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Began refactoring an old, overly complex(bloated) controller to align it with separation of concerns. 

### 🔍 Notes / Discoveries
- The best way to keep the code readable is to move the business rules into a service and keep the controller focused solely on orchestration

### 🎯 Next small step
- Continue refining architecture and testing skills
