### ⭐ What I learned
- Checked how to structure PHP tests for services.
- Explored Copilot code-review
- Refreshed my understanding of the Repository pattern to prepare for using it in a new Laravel project.

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Implemented Attributes to determine methods responsible for in one middleware 
- Improved few tests by adding type-safe assertions.
- Some logic has been introduced into the tests to maintain separation of concerns.

### 🔍 Notes /Discoveries
- Good tests clarify architecture.
- Realized how helpful clear separation of responsibilities is when working with middleware and attributes.
- Some of Copilot’s suggestions are a bit weird, however it still provides extra protection for the codebase by helping avoid simple mistakes

### 🎯 Next small step
- Add another small test tomorrow.
- Improve static analysis of the project
- Continue refining the middleware flow to keep the logic clean and predictable.
