### ⭐ What I learned
- Expored GitHub Actions workflows 
- Looked into PHP performance tricks
- Studied clean architecture principles in PHP

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Worked with GitHub Actions workflows
- Wrote a micro-benchmark comparing array_map and foreach.

### 🔍 Notes / Discoveries
- GitHub Actions workflows must exist in the target branch to trigger on pull requests, bootstrapping CI is often a two-step process.
- Static analysis requires explicit resource limits,  configuring memory consciously avoids flaky CI failures and keeps feedback predictable.
- Separating linters from static analysis keeps CI feedback fast and focused, style issues are cheap to fix, logic issues are not.

### 🎯 Next small step
- Try reorganizing a small demo project with layers
