### ⭐ What I learned
- Key Features in PHP 8.5
- Looked into Go basics: packages, modules, simple functions.

### 🛠 What I built or improved
- Created a tiny Go file with a basic function and ran it.  
- GitHub Actions: tests in Laravel
- Set up PHPStan + lint in Laravel

### 🔍 Notes / Discoveries
- Tests should describe intent, not implementation - otherwise refactoring becomes expensive.

### 🎯 Next small step
- Try writing a CLI function in Go.
