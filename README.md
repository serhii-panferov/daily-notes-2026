# daily-notes-2026

This repository is my personal learning journal for 2026.  
I use it to track small, consistent steps in improving my engineering skills with a strong focus on PHP,
while also exploring Go and React to broaden my technical toolkit.

The idea is simple:  
**even 15–30 minutes of progress every day accumulate into real growth.**

## 🎯 Goals for 2025
- Deepen expertise in PHP and modern backend practices  
- Improve architecture, testing, performance and clean code approaches  
- Explore Go for systems tasks and tooling  
- Explore React for frontend skills when needed  
- Maintain consistent activity on GitHub  
- Document ideas, discoveries, experiments, and results

## 📅 How this journal works

- One short note per day  
- Notes are grouped by month (`2025-12`, `2026-01`, …)  
- Each note is 5–10 lines: what I learned, practiced, or tried  
- Code experiments, small snippets, or micro-projects are welcome  
- The purpose is steady growth, not polished perfection
